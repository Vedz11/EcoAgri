We saw one of the critical issues to be lack of understanding, awareness and misconception about sustainable and regenerative farming and No data, tools or technology to forecast the prices for regenerative farming crops and to compensate for their loss. Hence we created one single application which  contains :

**Easy Approach Selection**: The farmer after introduction to our two ways to get benefit from regenerative farming selects if they want a short term approach which is less rewarding but will give them premium prices and immediate cashout. Whereas in a long term approach which is more rewarding in the long run they will get green credits to compensate for their loss which they can use to get farming equipments at subsidized rates.

**Short Term Approach**: Here the farmer will be directly connected with the premium sellers who sell to the market at high price with ensuring customers that the crop is organic, like all the Realiances, Dmarts, Amazons of India. Hence farmers will sell the crops at a higher than market price and get immediate payout.

**Long Term Approach**: Here the farmer will sell the crop at market rate, but to compensate for the loss they will be given green credits which they can use to get everything farming at subsidized rate and even use to pay water/electricity bills.Green credits are basically credit token given the long term approach users to compensate for their loss for selling yield at normal prices despite using regenerative methods. These credits are very valuable as these can be redeemed by you for all your farm equipments and that too at a subsidized rate. Green credits will help you massively in the long term and are the best way to improve your farming too. You can use these green credits to redeem them and get everything farming from tractors to fertilizers too at a subsidized rate. You can even redeem them to pay water and electricity bills. Remember 1 credit is equal to 1 rupee so no extra calculations. And you are fairly compensated for the loss endured for selling the yield at the normal price as the credit given will be the current premium price on the app subtracted by your selling price to ensure rightful allotment. And many more sub features too.
